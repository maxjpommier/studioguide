We're glad you're asking yourself these questions; your curiosity is a big part of what makes you a designer, and it's totally normal to feel overwhelmed at this point. [^1]

	In a company of this size, and a coordinated effort of this magnitude, it's easy to feel tiny… a single designer in a gaggle of many, and a small cohort of designers in a horde of hundreds of thousands. 

The thing is, you weren't hired as 'a cog in the machine', but as a design thinker with unique skills, experiences, and personal qualities.

You've come to IBM Design at some point in your career—whether it's at the beginning or 10 years in—looking to grow your skills, add to your experiences, and hone your qualities. And we're here to help.

####This section is all about you.

You as an IBM Designer, as a designer, and as an individual. What you choose to do with this information is up to you; just remember that you leave your work at the end of the day, but everything else comes home with you. You're out of school, but the opportunities to grow in every direction imaginable are still out there. At IBM, they're present in force. That's why what you do here goes beyond your product/project, and why it's important.

What follows is a free-flowing progression of the core values of an IBM Designer—take a gander, let it simmer, and jump into the action… even if you don't think you're completely ready.
